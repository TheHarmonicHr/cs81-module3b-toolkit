CS81 Math Toolkit Functions
This repository contains a custom JavaScript math toolkit developed for CS81 Module 3B. The goal of this assignment was to build, test, and document simple math functions using functional thinking and version control practices.

## ðŸ”§ Files Included

- `math.js` â€” A collection of custom JavaScript functions such as `double()`, `square()`, `isEven()`, and more.
- `PREDICTIONS.md` â€” My expectations for what each function should output before testing.
- `RESULTS.md` â€” The actual results after running and verifying the functions.
- `REFLECTION.md` â€” A summary of insights, patterns, and personal takeaways from the process.

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

- Practice writing clean, reusable JavaScript functions
- Learn how to test and debug code
- Understand functional logic and how small utilities can scale
- Use Git and GitHub to track development over time
- Reflect on coding patterns, logic, and unexpected discoveries
