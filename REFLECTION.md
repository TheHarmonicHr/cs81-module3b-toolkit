# Reflection on Math Toolkit

**Patterns and Structure**  
I noticed that almost every function follows clear, single-purpose logic: take input(s), perform a math operation, and return the result. This clarity made writing and understanding each function straightforward.

**Unexpected Outcomes or Surprises**  
Nothing behaved unexpectedlyâ€”the results matched my predictions. However, it was satisfying to see how consistently and efficiently JavaScript handles these operations, especially boolean checks like `isEven()` and `isOdd()`.

**Functional Thinking**  
Writing these functions helped me realize how modular design works: each simple function can be tested and reused independently. This makes code maintenance and debugging much easier.

**Real-World Application**  
This kind of toolkit could be used in calculators, data validation, or even simple game mechanics. Small reusable functions like these form the building blocks for more complex applications.
